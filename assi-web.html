      <h2>Food for a Family</h2>

      <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
      <p>Housing is the basis of stability and security for an individual or family. The centre of our social, emotional and sometimes economic lives, a home should be a sanctuary—a place to live in peace, security and dignity.</p>

        <p>As we all may have heard, Sylhet, Bangladesh is experiencing one of the worst floods in its history. Over a hundred thousand people over the 15 sub-districts in Sylhet are badly impacted. Flood situation is getting even worse. This happened due to swelling of major rivers caused by continuous rain and rush of waters from the rivers.</p>

    <p>When the floodwaters rushed in, ten-year-old Barsha and her family had to hurry to a shelter, leaving behind everything. The cramped shelter in Gowainghat of Sylhet, one of the worst-affected districts, provided respite from the rising water. But, with no tube wells or taps nearby, Barsha had to go without clean drinking water for days.“It was really hard for me and my family to get drinking water since the floodwaters rushed in and we arrived at the shelter,” she says after receiving water purification tablets delivered by UNICEF. “Now we can finally have a drink of water. It is the first clean water I have had in days!” </p>
